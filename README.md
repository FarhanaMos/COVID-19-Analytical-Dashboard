# COVID-19-Analytical-Dashboard
This project was group assignment we had on our Data Storytellning course at EC Utbildning. Explored covid-19 real data. The primary data we will all be working with is the worldwide COVID data repository continuously collected, curated and meticulously maintained by the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE).
