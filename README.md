# COVID-19-Analytical-Dashboard
This project was our group assignment on our Data Storytellning course at EC Utbildning. Explored covid-19 real data. The primary data we will all be working with is the worldwide COVID data repository continuously collected, curated and meticulously maintained by the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) and made freely available via what eventually became known as the Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center. 


There is a PDF where we have written and explained different kinds of visualization with data storytelling, its in Swedish.  Here's a sneak peek on our report.

Note: All visualizations and figures not completely accurate, as some data, especially regarding recovered cases, are missing. We have made several attempts to fix this, without success.

The diagram at the bottom shows the number of active cases over time from April 2020 to March 2023. It is also possible to choose what the user wants to see; active cases, recoveries and deaths and vaccinations and how these have evolved. This helps us see how the pandemic has changed and identify key periods of increases or decreases. The number of active cases reached 532 million and continued to rise. Despite extensive efforts to slow the spread, the world saw a tragic number of deaths, reaching 7 million. The mortality rate was 1.02%, which meant that for every 100 infected people, about one died.

To be able to see specific continents or countries, it is possible to select countries and select a time interval at the top left corner. After the selected country, the title will change
to that particular country and it will show key figures and line charts according to which continent/country and date the user has selected, as for example below where we selected Canada.
